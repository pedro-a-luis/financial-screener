# Revised Loading Strategy - 2 Year Historical Window

## Executive Summary

**Updated**: 2025-10-21 07:00 WEST
**Change**: Reduced historical price data from 5 years to 2 years
**API Cost**: Unchanged (11 calls per stock)
**Benefits**: 60% database reduction, faster loading, same API quota usage

## Understanding EODHD API Costs

### Per-Request Costs

| Endpoint Type | Cost per Request |
|--------------|------------------|
| Fundamental Data | 10 API calls |
| End-of-Day Prices | 1 API call (regardless of date range!) |
| Live Data | 1 API call per ticker |
| Intraday Data | 5 API calls |
| News | 5 API calls |

### Our Usage Pattern

**Per stock**:
```
Fundamentals:  10 calls  (all 13 sections in one request)
Price history:  1 call   (2 years of daily OHLCV)
-------------------------------------------
Total:         11 calls per stock
```

**Critical insight**: The EOD price endpoint costs **1 call** whether you request 1 day or 10 years of data!

## Why 2 Years Instead of 5?

### Benefits

1. **Database Size**: 60% reduction in price records
   - Old: 27.3M price records
   - New: 10.9M price records
   - Saved: 16.4M records

2. **Performance**: Faster queries and smaller backup sizes

3. **Relevance**: 2 years is sufficient for:
   - Technical analysis (52-week highs/lows, moving averages)
   - Trend analysis
   - Volatility calculations
   - Most screening criteria

4. **Same API Cost**: Still 1 call per stock for prices

### Trade-offs

- ‚ùå Less historical data for long-term backtesting
- ‚ùå Cannot analyze multi-year trends
- ‚ùå May need to re-fetch if we want more history later

**Conclusion**: 2 years is the sweet spot for initial load. We can always extend later.

## Per-Exchange Breakdown

| Exchange | Stocks | API Calls | Priority | Day |
|----------|--------|-----------|----------|-----|
| **NYSE** | 2,343 | 25,773 | High | 1 ‚úÖ |
| **NASDAQ** | 4,090 | 44,990 | High | 1-2 |

## API Quota Management

### Daily Monitoring

```bash
# Before starting any job, check current usage
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo "Quota status: Check EODHD dashboard"
echo "Safe to proceed if usage < 10,000 calls"
```

### Safety Thresholds

| Usage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 0-50,000 | ‚úÖ Safe - Full speed ahead |
| 50,000-75,000 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution - Reduce batch size |
| 75,000-90,000 | üî∂ Warning - Small batches only |
| 90,000-100,000 | üî¥ STOP - Wait for reset |

### Failure Handling

Failed API calls still consume quota:
- 404 Not Found: 10 calls wasted (fundamentals)
- Invalid ticker: 10 calls wasted
- Network error: May consume calls

**Strategy**: Pre-validate tickers when possible to minimize failures.

## Database Impact

### Price Records (2 years)

```
Per stock: ~500 trading days
Total stocks: 21,816
Total records: 10,908,000

Estimated size:
- Uncompressed: ~1.5 GB
- PostgreSQL compressed: ~800 MB
```

### Assets Table

```
Records: 21,816
Columns: 72 + 13 JSONB
Estimated size: ~2 GB (with JSONB fundamentals)
```

### Total Database Size (Complete)

```
Assets:              ~2 GB
Prices (2 years):    ~800 MB
Technical indicators: ~50 MB
Other tables:        ~150 MB
-----------------------------------
Total:               ~3 GB
```

---

## Job Configuration

### Updated Settings (2-year window)

```yaml
# kubernetes/job-phase1-us-markets.yaml
env:
  - name: HISTORICAL_WINDOW_DAYS
    value: "730"  # 2 years
```

**Note**: The code now uses `2 * 365` days in [main_enhanced.py:50](../services/data-collector/src/main_enhanced.py#L50)

---

## Cost Projections

### One-Time Initial Load

```
21,816 stocks √ó 11 calls = 239,976 API calls
At 100K/day limit = 3 days minimum
With failures/retries = 4 days realistic
```

### Daily Maintenance (After Initial Load)

**Fundamentals**: Only update quarterly
```
21,816 stocks / 90 days = ~242 stocks/day
242 √ó 10 calls = 2,420 calls/day
```

**Prices**: Update daily for all stocks
```
21,816 stocks √ó 1 call = 21,816 calls/day
```

**Total daily maintenance**: ~24,236 calls/day
**Quota remaining**: ~75,764 calls/day for new stocks/analysis

---

## Optimization Opportunities

### Future Improvements

1. **Batch Fundamentals Updates**
   - Only fetch for stocks with quarterly earnings
   - Use bulk API endpoints where available
   - Cache fundamentals for 90 days

2. **Incremental Price Updates**
   - Only fetch prices for changed dates
   - Use "from=last_date" parameter

3. **Smart Retry Logic**
   - Don't retry invalid tickers
   - Exponential backoff for rate limits
   - Skip delisted stocks

4. **Exchange-Level Bulk APIs**
   - Some exchanges support bulk endpoints (100 calls for entire exchange)
   - Worth investigating for large exchanges

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Implement in Airflow (Future)

```python
# Check quota before DAG run
if api_usage_today > 80000:
    raise AirflowSkipException("API quota too high")

# Log usage after each task
log_api_usage(task_name, calls_used)

# Send alert at thresholds
if api_usage_today > 90000:
    send_alert("API quota critical!")
```

---

## Rollback Plan

### If 2 Years Isn't Enough

To extend back to 5 years (or any period):

1. **Update code**:
   ```python
   # main_enhanced.py line 50
   start_date = date.today() - timedelta(days=5 * 365)
   ```

2. **Rebuild image**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-and-distribute-data-collector.sh
   ```

3. **Re-fetch prices only**:
   ```bash
   # Create job that only fetches additional price history
   # Cost: 1 call per stock = 21,816 calls
   ```

**Note**: Fundamentals don't need re-fetching, just prices!

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. ‚úÖ Use 2-year window for all new loads
2. ‚úÖ Monitor daily API usage in EODHD dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Set alerts at 50K, 75K, 90K thresholds

### Short-term

1. Implement API usage tracking in Redis
2. Add pre-flight quota checks to all jobs
3. Create Airflow DAGs for scheduled loads

### Long-term

1. Evaluate if 100K/day is sufficient for operations
2. Consider upgrading to 200K/day plan if needed
3. Implement intelligent caching strategies
