## What We Can Build Now

### Phase 2: Technical Indicators (Week 1)

**Objective**: Calculate 35+ technical indicators from price data

**What to Build**:

1. **Technical Analyzer Service** (Celery workers)
   ```
   services/technical-analyzer/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── indicators.py         ← 35 indicator calculations
   │   ├── celery_app.py         ← Distributed processing
   │   ├── tasks.py              ← Celery tasks
   │   └── database.py           ← Write to technical_indicators table
   ```

2. **Indicators to Calculate**:
   - **Trend**: SMA (20/50/200), EMA, MACD, ADX
   - **Momentum**: RSI, Stochastic, CCI, ROC
   - **Volatility**: Bollinger Bands, ATR, Standard Deviation
   - **Volume**: OBV, CMF, VWAP
   - **Support/Resistance**: Pivot Points, Fibonacci

3. **Technology**:
   - **Polars** for fast dataframe operations (already in stack)
   - **TA-Lib** or **pandas-ta** for indicator calculations
   - **Celery** for distributed processing across Pi cluster

4. **Deployment**:
   - DaemonSet on all 7 worker nodes
   - Process ~720 stocks per worker
   - Complete 5,045 stocks in ~10 minutes

**Why Now**: We have 5.1M price records ready to analyze!

### Phase 3: Screening Engine (Week 2)

**Objective**: Filter stocks based on criteria (value, growth, momentum, etc.)

**What to Build**:

1. **Screening Service** (FastAPI + Polars)
   ```
   services/api/
   ├── routers/
   │   ├── screening.py          ← Screen endpoints
   │   ├── filters.py            ← Filter logic
   │   └── strategies.py         ← Pre-built strategies
   ├── models/
   │   └── screening_models.py   ← Pydantic models
   └── utils/
       └── polars_queries.py     ← Fast queries
   ```

2. **Screening Strategies**:
   - **Value**: Low P/E, P/B, PEG < 1, High dividend yield
   - **Growth**: Revenue/EPS growth, High profit margins
   - **Momentum**: RSI signals, MACD crossovers, Moving average trends
   - **Quality**: High ROE, Low debt/equity, Consistent earnings
   - **Dividend**: Yield > 3%, Payout ratio < 60%, Dividend growth

3. **Features**:
   - Real-time filtering with Polars (2-10x faster than Pandas)
   - Combined filters (e.g., "Value + Momentum")
   - Saved searches
   - Watchlists

4. **API Endpoints**:
   ```
   GET /api/screen?strategy=value&limit=50
   GET /api/screen?pe_ratio__lt=15&dividend_yield__gt=0.03
   GET /api/screen/strategies  (list pre-built strategies)
   POST /api/screen/custom     (custom criteria)
   ```

**Why Now**: We have fundamentals + technicals for 5,045 stocks!

### Phase 4: Recommendation System (Week 3)

**Objective**: Generate buy/sell/hold recommendations with reasoning

**What to Build**:

1. **Recommendation Engine** (Python ML/Rules-based)
   ```
   services/analyzer/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── recommendation.py     ← Main engine
   │   ├── scoring.py            ← Scoring algorithms
   │   ├── calculators/
   │   │   ├── fundamental.py    ← 40% weight
   │   │   ├── technical.py      ← 20% weight
   │   │   ├── sentiment.py      ← 30% weight (future)
   │   │   └── risk.py           ← 10% weight
   │   └── tasks.py              ← Celery tasks
   ```

2. **Scoring System** (0-10 scale):
   ```
   Fundamental Analysis (40%):
   - Valuation metrics (P/E, P/B, PEG)
   - Financial health (debt, cash flow)
   - Growth metrics (revenue, earnings)
   - Quality (ROE, margins)

   Technical Analysis (20%):
   - Trend indicators
   - Momentum signals
   - Support/resistance levels

   Sentiment Analysis (30%):
   - Analyst ratings (we have this!)
   - News sentiment (future)
   - Social media (future)

   Risk Assessment (10%):
   - Volatility (beta, ATR)
   - Drawdown analysis
   - Correlation
   ```

3. **Recommendation Levels**:
   - **STRONG BUY** (8.5-10): All metrics align positively
   - **BUY** (7.0-8.5): Good fundamentals + technicals
   - **HOLD** (5.0-7.0): Mixed signals
   - **SELL** (3.0-5.0): Concerning metrics
   - **STRONG SELL** (0-3.0): Multiple red flags

4. **Output**:
   ```json
   {
     "ticker": "AAPL",
     "recommendation": "BUY",
     "score": 7.8,
     "confidence": "high",
     "reasoning": [
       "Strong fundamentals (P/E 38.3 vs sector avg 45)",
       "Positive momentum (RSI 62, MACD bullish)",
       "Analyst consensus: Strong Buy (rating 3.9/5)",
       "Risk: Moderate (beta 1.2, volatility in range)"
     ],
     "target_price": 195.50,
     "stop_loss": 172.00
   }
   ```

**Why Now**: We have all the fundamentals + analyst ratings!

### Phase 5: API Service (Week 4)

**Objective**: FastAPI REST service for frontend

**What to Build**:

1. **FastAPI Application**:
   ```
   services/api/
   ├── main.py                   ← FastAPI app
   ├── routers/
   │   ├── assets.py             ← GET /api/assets
   │   ├── screening.py          ← GET /api/screen
   │   ├── recommendations.py    ← GET /api/recommendations
   │   ├── technicals.py         ← GET /api/technicals/{ticker}
   │   └── health.py             ← GET /api/health
   ├── models/                   ← Pydantic models
   ├── database/                 ← DB queries (Polars)
   └── cache/                    ← Redis caching
   ```

2. **Key Endpoints**:
   ```
   Assets:
   GET /api/assets                    (list with pagination)
   GET /api/assets/{ticker}           (detailed view)
   GET /api/assets/{ticker}/prices    (price history)
   GET /api/assets/{ticker}/fundamentals

   Screening:
   GET /api/screen                    (filter stocks)
   GET /api/screen/strategies         (pre-built)
   POST /api/screen/custom            (custom filters)

   Recommendations:
   GET /api/recommendations           (top picks)
   GET /api/recommendations/{ticker}  (detailed)
   GET /api/watchlist                 (user watchlist)

   Technical Analysis:
   GET /api/technicals/{ticker}       (all indicators)
   GET /api/technicals/{ticker}/rsi   (specific indicator)
   ```

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   ```
   Redis layers:
   - Assets: 4h TTL (fundamentals don't change often)
   - Prices: 1h TTL (updated daily)
   - Technicals: 1h TTL (recalculated daily)
   - Recommendations: 24h TTL
   - Screening results: 1h TTL
   ```

**Why Now**: We have data, now we need to serve it!

### Phase 6: Frontend Dashboard (Week 5-6)

**Objective**: React web UI for visualization and interaction

**What to Build**:

1. **React Dashboard**:
   ```
   frontend/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── pages/
   │   │   ├── Dashboard.tsx         ← Main dashboard

---

## What's Missing (But Not Critical Yet)

### News & Sentiment
- Can add later using EODHD News API (5 calls per request)
- Or integrate NewsAPI.org, Alpha Vantage News
- Not blocking for MVP

### Real-time Prices
- Current data is end-of-day (perfect for screener)
- Live prices require different API tier
- Can add later if needed

### Options Data
- Not needed for stock screener
- Future enhancement

---

## Testing Strategy

### With 5,045 Stocks We Can:

1. **Validate Calculations**:
   - Test indicators on AAPL (lots of documentation to verify)
   - Cross-check with Yahoo Finance, TradingView

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Screen 5,045 stocks in <1 second (target)
   - Polars should handle this easily

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Stocks with missing data
   - Penny stocks with low volume
   - Newly IPO'd companies

4. **User Scenarios**:
   - "Find value stocks with high dividend"
   - "Show me growth stocks with low P/E"
   - "Tech stocks with bullish MACD"

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### Tomorrow (Oct 22):

**Option A: Start Building** (Recommended)
1. Create technical-analyzer service
2. Implement first 10 indicators
3. Test on 100 stocks
4. Deploy to cluster

**Option B: Load More Data**
1. Use fresh quota to load remaining 1,388 US stocks
2. Complete NYSE + NASDAQ (100% coverage)
3. Then start building

**My Recommendation**: **Start building NOW!**
- 5,045 stocks is plenty for development
- Can load more stocks in parallel while building
- Better to have working system with 5K stocks than waiting for 21K
